# Agent View

**A lightweight terminal-based agent orchestrator for managing multiple AI coding assistants.**

Run multiple AI coding agents in parallel and manage them from a single dashboard. Agent View is a lightweight tmux session manager built for AI-assisted development workflows - monitor agent status in real-time, get notifications when agents finish or need input, and seamlessly switch between sessions.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Codex CLI**, and any custom AI coding tool.

## Why Agent View?

When working with AI coding agents, you often need to run multiple agents on different tasks - one refactoring a module, another writing tests, a third exploring a bug. Agent View lets you orchestrate all of them from one place instead of juggling terminal tabs. It's the missing multi-agent management layer for your AI-assisted development workflow.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Dashboard** - View all your AI coding assistant sessions at a glance with real-time status indicators
- **Smart Notifications** - Get notified when an agent finishes a task or needs your input, so you can context-switch efficiently
- **Session Management** - Create, stop, restart, and delete coding agent sessions with keyboard shortcuts
- **Git Worktree Integration** - Automatically create isolated git worktrees for each agent session, keeping your branches clean
- **Tool Agnostic** - Works as a Claude Code manager, Gemini CLI orchestrator, OpenCode dashboard, or with any custom AI tool
- **Keyboard-First** - Fully navigable terminal UI with keyboard shortcuts for maximum productivity
- **Session Groups** - Organize sessions into groups by project or workflow
- **Persistent State** - Sessions survive terminal restarts and system reboots via tmux

### Status Detection

Agent View monitors your sessions and shows real-time status indicators:

| Status | Symbol | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Running** | `●` green | Agent is actively working |
| **Waiting** | `◐` yellow | Needs your input |
| **Idle** | `○` gray | Ready for commands |
| **Stopped** | `◻` gray | Session was stopped |
| **Error** | `✗` red | Something went wrong |

## Installation

### Quick Install (MITRE)

```bash
curl -kfsSL https://gitlab.mitre.org/mdoyle/agent-view/-/raw/main/install-mitre.sh | bash

### Create a Session

1. Press `n` to open the new session dialog
2. Select your AI tool (Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, etc.)
3. Enter the project path
4. Optionally enable git worktree for an isolated branch
5. Press `Enter` to create and attach

### Configuration

Create `~/.agent-view/config.json` to customize defaults:

```json
{
  "defaultTool": "claude",
  "worktree": {
    "defaultBaseBranch": "main",
    "command": "git worktree"
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for session management
- At least one AI coding tool installed (claude, gemini, opencode, etc.)
